This project focuses on developing an interactive dashboard for traders and asset managers to analyze FAANG stock performance over the past 15 years. The dashboard integrates historical stock prices and technical indicators to help identify market trends, entry/exit points, and trading opportunities.

Our analysis covers key technical indicators such as Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Aroon Oscillator, Stochastic Oscillator, and On-Balance Volume (OBV) to assess stock momentum, volatility, and investor sentiment. Findings reveal that META has emerged as the top performer, Netflix exhibits the highest volatility, and FAANG stocks show strong uptrends in most periods.

The dashboard serves as a decision support system, enabling traders to track stock trends, assess post-market price movements, and refine trading strategies. Insights from this project offer valuable tools for optimizing investment decisions in volatile markets.
